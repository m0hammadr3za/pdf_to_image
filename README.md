# PDF to Image

You need to have python installed on your device. You also need to install “pdf2image” module (from https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/) and pay attention to instructions for installing this module. As mentioned in the module's page, if you are on windows, you need to install poppler too.

To use this script. put all pdf files you want to convert in the "pdfs" directory. pdfs directory itself should be in the same directory that the script is in. then run the script. After execution for each pdf file there will be a directory with the name of the pdf file which contains all images for that pdf file in images directory.

Depending on your pdf file size conversion may take some time!
