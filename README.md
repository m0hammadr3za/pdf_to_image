# Development

A python app for converting pdf files to images. The script itself is made of different functions, each doing a specific task. so changing the functionality is easy if you want to add any features.

## Requirements for the python script

You need to have python installed on your device. you also need to have [pdf2image] module (https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/) installed and please pay attention to instructions for installing this module. As mentioned in the module's page, if you are on windows, you need to install poppler too.

## Usage

To use this script put all pdf files you want to convert in the "pdfs" directory. pdfs directory itself should be in the same directory that the script is in. then run the script. after execution, In images directory, for each pdf file, there will be a directory with the name of the pdf file which contains all images for that pdf file.

Depending on the pdf files's size conversion may take some time!
